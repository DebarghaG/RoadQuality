Road Quality monitoring with the help of cars and our IoT solution. 

Use the code in master, along with : 
1. Bluetooth module
2. Ultrasonic HC-SR-04
3. GPS module. 

Will relay the texture of the road along with the GPS data in the form of speed etc to 
an app set up over serial bluetooth on the drivers phone. The driver's phone sends it 
to our servers where analytics are done along with a the creation of a real time heatmap
of the condition of the roads.
